            <h3>TRAFFIC RULES VIOLATION DETECTION SYSTEM</h3>
        
            <P>The majority of vehicles on road in India is increasing faster because of which traffic management has become 
                one of the main problems. The effective management of traffic is possible when every violation on the road is often detected. 
                The use of conventional/manual method together with existing technologies to detect traffic rule violation is inefficient as a 
                results of which traffic management has become very difficult. During this project, the system is proposed with the assistance 
                of image processing technologies to detect major violation like over speeding and helmet detection together with number 
                plate recognition process which will make job of traffic management easier</P>
